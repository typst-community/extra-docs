> Among [_Tools that can be useful_](#tools-that-can-be-useful) at the end of this page, [typst-package-check](https://github.com/typst/package-check) is the only official one. Unofficial pre-built binaries for it are available at [Typst dev builds](https://typst-community.github.io/dev-builds/#package-check). However, the PR robot will run it automatically when you submitting your package, so usually it's unnecessary to use it locally.
